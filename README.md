# Personal website with Next.js

![Sanity+Next+TailwindCSS](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/81pocpw8/production/8b36e4a78aea2fddf80250f845455c64fa2ad973-2400x1500.jpg?w=1000&h=500&fit=clip&auto=format)
This starter is a statically generated personal website that uses [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) for the frontend and [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=nextjs-v3vercelstarter) to handle its content. It comes with a native Sanity Studio that offers features like real-time collaboration, instant side-by-side content previews, and intuitive editing.

The Studio connects to Sanity Content Lake, which gives you hosted content APIs with a flexible query language, on-demand image transformations, powerful patching, and more. You can use this starter to kick-start a personal website or learn these technologies.
